# Small Business Finance Tracker

This finance tracker is a lightweight, command-line C++ application to manage transactions. It supports adding, viewing, and editing transactions, stored in a local JSON file for storage.

## Description

This tool allows users to:
- Record transactions with a **date**, **category**, and **amount**
- View a list of all stored transactions
- Save data to a JSON file to ensure storage across sessions

It's is a simple and effective tool for small business owners, freelancers, or students  who want to manage their expenses and income without using spreadsheets or external apps

## Code Structure

```
Finance-Tracker/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.cpp          # Main file that handles the user input
â”œâ”€â”€ classes.hpp       # transactionMaker class with core transaction logic and functions
â”œâ”€â”€ json.hpp          # JSON library (from nlohmann/json)
â”œâ”€â”€ info.json         # transaction storage
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md         # Documentation

```

## How the Code Works
### `main.cpp`
- Loads data from `info.json` at startup
- Calls transaction functions
- Prompts to continue or exit after each action
- Saves to `info.json` before exiting

### `transactionMaker` Class (in `classes.hpp`)
- Uses a dynamic array of `transaction` structs
- Auto-resizes when full
- Reads from/writes to JSON file using `nlohmann/json`
